# Heroists🦸‍♂

Heroists is a 2D roguelike turn-based combat game where the goal is to survive for as long
as you can against enemy monsters by creating the perfect arsenal of heroes using your earned
money.

Heroists is currently in a prototype (and kinda buggy) state as it's been put on pause to focus
on other projects and obligations. Most of what you can see is final except for the placeholder
art such as all the sprites and icons.
